1. What is the use of bcrypt.js in Authentication ?

The password goes to the server through header. 
And since when we define header in api it is visible to everyone. So to hide this user level details to anyother person we will use bcrypt.js

2. Without authentication authorization cannot take place.
-> Without authorization authentication cannot take place.

3. We have used async in app.post("/login", async(req, res)) {}
-> So that we can work asynchornously. since multiple people utilise the auth at the same time so it's better to make it a async function.

Utilities of Bcrypt-> HashSync & CompareSync
4.1.Hashsync -> converted the password to hashed password using hashSync function. Hashpassword length -> 8
4.2.CompareSync-> to compare the current password which is recived in the req.header to the password stored in the DB.


5. What is the Secret in JWT and why is it used?
In simple terms, the JWT secret is a private key used by the server to protect the token from tampering.

6. When with request header comes server authenticates
//Client sends everything with header

7. Next act's as a middle ware if the token is valid then proceed else move to catch.

8. JSON Web token is divided into 3 parts
example -> 
{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InNhYiIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjkyMjcwMiwiZXhwIjoxNzY2OTI2MzAyfQ.FyT5ArMyye3QfTKYOBfjG7IAi8Yw05aCRRRteQMBFGs"
}

9. This token will be used in as bearer token to authenticate the profile endpoint and thus decode the encypted user-data.
