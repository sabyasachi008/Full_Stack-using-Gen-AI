1.Difference between statefull and stateless Authentication Patterns?

Statefull -> Which maintains state or data or server side.
State is a data with which we map any thing to maintain it.

Clinet --> Username/Password > server
Client <-----  Session uid < -- Server

Server can send UID in form of Cookies{used in server side}
/ Response
/ headers{mainly used in restAPIs}



Stateless -> Which has no state
