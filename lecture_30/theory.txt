JWT -> Json Web token -> Signed proof of authentication.
info transfer between client and server

//Old way -> Server stores the session data, and client sends the session Id

// JWT -> No storing of the session, Client stores token, stateless

// xxxx.yyyy.zzzz
Header.payload.signature

header -> {
    //algorithm with which we have encoded information of that 

}

Eg -> 
header => {
    alg: "HS256, 
    type: JWT,     
}

payload -> {
    id:'cb',
    "username":"head345"
}

signature {
    header + payload + Secret
}

JWT Can be read by user but cannot be modified.
jwt.verify() -> matches signature

Secret is a private KEY for signin and verify jwts.

JWT tokens should always expire -> Hence they are shortlived.

//There are stored in client -> Memory {localstorage} HTTP cookies.

JWT is a stateless signed token which stores in client

The token in JWT is called access token -> user for protected apis, and sent with every call.
It is stored in FE side localstorage cookies 

Refresh Token -> Used to get new access token, Without loggin in again.


Refresh Token is stored (DB/cookies)
when access token expires -> FE Calls then refresh token is called then new access access token is generated -> user continues.

Why refresh tokens are kept for a longer time?
-> So that we can get access after we get verified once. In order to avoid multiple logins on the same UserId.
