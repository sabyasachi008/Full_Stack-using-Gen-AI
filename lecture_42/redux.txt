What is Redux?

Redux is a global container. It stores all the state changes related things. Anything which would be present in the state will be contained in the redux.

Any changes is performed only by reducer.

To use Redux we have to create a Redux ToolKit and inside it there is everything.

counterSlice -> Slice is used for Reducer purpose.
CreateSlice -> Inbuilt function which helps in changing. Handles the state change things
