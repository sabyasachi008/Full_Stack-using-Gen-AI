#Next vs React

React -> UI Component 
-> Hooks 
-> Theory -> Output based Questions -> Online test/ Screening rounds.

React's Drawback -> Client side rendering.
Backend data is processed in client -> so SEO ranking get's down.
To handle the issue of SEO ranking there is NextJS

In next JS -> there is file based routing
and SSR -> Server Side Rendering. -> This concept is called static site generation. 
Better SEO since intitial load time is less.
build full web apps.
File based routing -> In a pages file contains all our files.

EJS -> Template to create a bare minimum code.


NEXT JS -> folder structure
page.tsx -> App.jsx
layout.tsx -> index.jsx

Linked KeyWord.

link -> prevents automatic page reload
everything is internally implemented in HTML in client side so it is fast 

Any client interation things like button click toggle is done using CSR -> via Client side rendering to use client side rendering we have to mention "use client" in the begining of the code.


For creating Backend Code -> 
create api folder in-side 
and inside api create apis for particulars like for user -> create a user folder and inside user folder create route.ts {inside route.ts write your api}
